Welcome to the new version of the website. The old authenyo.xyz code (if you can call it that) can finally rest now. It was so messy but I loved it. 

# Why would you do that wtf why is it dead you're so mean dude wtf you fucking killed it im scared
I've been meaning to rewrite my website for a while now. The old version has been changed and beaten up so many times doing anything to it is miserable. We're now using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) with the [Terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal) theme. Yes I stole it from [penny](https://noob.quest) shut the fuck up. It looks better than the old version, but I still wanna mess with it a lot to make it have that **authen**tic swag.

I plan to actually use the blog now. I'm still retarded and I still can't write, but at least writing blog posts is much easier now. I actually don't know what to write about but I'll figure that out later. 

If you want to look at the source, it's available [here](https://github.com/authenyoo/website-zola) and also in the footer. If you ever wanna use the old website (that won't receive any updates it's just gonna be there until it rots), it's hosted [here](https://v1.authenyo.xyz/) on a different subdomain.
